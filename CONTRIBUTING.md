# Contributing

When submitting PRs with links please keep in mind what we specifically seek resources & libraries related to the TALL stack and not specifically to one part of the stack. For example, resources specifically about Alpine.js aren't what we looking for but something that combines Tailwind CSS & Laravel can be submitted. Try to reason about why your PR should be accepted.

Make sure your PR adheres to [the rules set by the main awesome project](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md).
